# This workflow performs various tasks for cleanup, triage, ... on an individual GitHub Issue
# It should be called based on issue events
# Note: re-usable workflows must be in the .github/workflows folder, amongst other workflows dedicated
# to the jahia-modules-action repository. Thus using "reusable-" prefix to easily identify them.
