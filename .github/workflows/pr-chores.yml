            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! üëãüèº
            
            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Details:
            
            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```

            Sample valid messages:

            A PR introducing a breaking change(!)
            ```
            feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
            ```

            A regular commit
            ```
            docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
            ```

            _This message will be deleted once the PR title conforms with the convention._

      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
